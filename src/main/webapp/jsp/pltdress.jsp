<p style="font-family:Times New Roman" ><b><p style="color:blue;">Step 1: Collect Bags!</p></b>You'll also need - scissors
          				      - sewing machine (obviously not essential but VERY useful)
                              - threads of the colours of bags that you're using (or different if you want!)
                              - sellotape (instead of pins!)
                              - belt
                              - needle (the thinner the better)
                              </p>

<b><p style="color:blue;">Step 2: Decide on a Design.</p></b>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman" >Lay your bags out, try different combinations of bags for the top and skirt parts. If it helps tie the bags to yourself to get an idea of what the dress would look like.
When deciding on the top part make sure the bag will fit you so if you're a bigger gal then you need to look for a bigger bag! Remember it's better to get a bag which is too big as a bag which is too small will rip, and that's not good!!
Be adventurous, try combinations that you wouldn't be immediately drawn to, you never know what might inspire you!
For the top part you will need one bag (some bags are quite see through so you may either want to choose a bag that isn't or wear a vest or similar 
instead) and for the skirt you will need 3+ bags depending on the size and tightness you want. I used 5. For a tighter fitting one I would have used 3.

<b><p style="color:blue;">Step 3: Cut the Bags!</b>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman" >Straighten the bottom of the bag out and cut the bottom off as close to the seam as possible, if the bag is for the skirt straighten the top and cut the handles off too. If it's the top part DO NOT cut the handles off, you will probably need to make the 'arm holes' bigger as most of the handles of bags I've used are waaay to tight on my arms/shoulders! When cutting the bags try and make it as smooth a cut as possible, without nicks, these will be a point of weakness from which a large rip could form so avoid at all costs! 
The pictures describe what I've said here better!</p>

<b><p style="color:blue;">Step 4: Skirt- Preparation!</p></b>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman" >A tip to seeing if you have enough bags for the skirt - take a belt or length of fabric and thread your 'top and
 tailed' bags onto it. Tie it around your waist and spread the bags evenly. Add more/remove some until you're happy. It's up to you as to how many bags
  is enough, do you want a tight fitting skirt? Or a big floaty one? (it will be very floaty after all, it is made of plastic!)

<b><p style="color:blue;">Step 5: Skirt- Sewing Together!</p></b>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman">Flatten the bags out and take 2 and align them so they are folded down the original edges. Use the taggy bits at 
the top to help you (this is why you didn't cut them off from these pieces). Line the bottom of one 'bag' up with the top of another, as some bags are
 different sizes line up one edge so the bottom edge of the skirt is straight. Use sellotape to keep them together, make sure it is a few cm away from
  the edge you are going to sew. Trim of the taggy bits to make it easier to sew.

<b><p style="color:blue;">Step 6: Skirt- Shaping!</p></b>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman">On the edge which isn't straight start to make dart like things, roughly 4cm long (so taking out 8cm of fabric),
 they're not going to be darts (unless of course you decide to make your dress that way of course) but that sort of fold. Secure with tape. I made on
 every join between the bags and in the centre of every bag. This made the waistline a good size so I stopped there. You may need to add more or less
 depending on your size and the number of bags you've used.

Take it to the machine and sew around the top edge making sure that the 'darts' fold the same way every time. Going through this many layers of plastic
 may upset your machine a little, I used the hand powered bit a few times when it got stuck so be aware that this may happen! Remember the backtacking 
 trick</p>

<b><p style="color:blue;">Step 7: Top Half!</p></b>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman">So you have your plastic bag top, bottom open and sleeve holes enlarged. Do you want an interesting neck line? A V neck? A boat neck? A square neck? Try the top on and mark (with a pen or similar, whiteboard/drywipe markers are good!) where the neckline should sit then cut it :D just be aware that on corners ripping will occur easily so if possible go for a curvy neckline. If it's symmetrical you could fold the bag in half then cut.

On the handles the plastic is folded and secured, to make it look nicer take the half that is at the back and cut it across the seal (look at the pictures
, explaining it is hard!!) and then cut it off, cutting it smoothly so it joins the backline of the dress. Repeat at the front.

<b><p style="color:blue;">Step 8: Joining the Skirt to the Top :D</p></b>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman">Turn the skirt inside out and slot the top RIGHT WAY OUT inside the skirt. (I did this bit wrong so I just don't want people making the same mistake :P ) Tack (with tape) the two pieces together at 4 points like the points of a compass. Sew together with a cm seam, making sure you're NOT sewing over the sewing already on in the skirt as this weakens it a lot (trial and error...) and it one layer rips as shown...

<b><p style="color:blue;">Step 9: Belt (optional But It Hides the Join)</p></b>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman">Fold the bag you want to use for the belt in half as shown in the first pic, fold it in this way again. Cut the handles off. Unfold the bag and take the two sides and pull it into a narrow band shape. If there's a particular pattern on the bag that you want to be visible on the belt try and get it to be at the front.

Fold and scrunch until its a bit like the picture! Sew across the belt at the original fold of the bag. Repeat on the other side.

In the centre of the belt secure it together at the back with tape or by hand sewing.

<b><p style="color:blue;">Step 10: Attach Belt</p></b>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman">Mark the dress on the join line at both sides so it's easier to line up the belt. But the belt around the dress and have it on the machine. Tack forwards and backwards a few times along the stitching you've already made on the belt (not too many times or the plastic will tear)

<b><p style="color:blue;">Step 11: Extra Finishing Touches</p></b>
<p style="font-family:Times New Roman">Collar- Choose another bag and cut the sides off, from the inside edge of the handles straight down. Cut the handles open . Stick them onto the inside of the neckline with most of the plastic to be folded out to the front. Sew them on with a 5mm seam.

Fold the collar out and cut them to the shape you want!!

Bow- take some off-cuts or cut some new and tie bows around say the shoulder straps or perhaps the belt. Or just tie a knot!
